                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Chynna Murphy - Rubeck. In my profesisonal career, I am a Technical Consultant who specializes in Cloud Infrastructure + Systems Architecture and Software Implementation. Outside of my professional career, I am a college student at George Mason Universiy studying Information Technology with a concentration in Web Development and Multimedia.</p>
                <p>I taught myself how to code HTML when I was 13 years old during my Summer Break. I used to experiment with customizing Tumblr Templates to make them my own. Once I was in High School, I took Web Design classes as well as other Multimedia classes and I obtained my Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 certificate at 17 years old. After taking Web Design classes, I wanted to learn Computer Science so I took Java Programming classes.</p>
                <h2>Career Objective</h2>
                <p>My career objective is to further expand my skills in AWS Cloud and Web Application Development so that I can work in a career more closely related to Web Development.</p>
                <p><b>If you can see this, this code has been added using AWS CodePipeline.</b></p>
